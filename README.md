# Implementation of Efros & Leung's Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling algorithm - NYU Spring 2010, Computational Photography

#What is this repo?

This repository consists of MatLab code/functions that implement Efros and Leung's Texture Synthesis algorithm (without the color examples). The functions create new images via sampling from the original seed by finding patches in the source image that are similar to an unfilled pixel's filled neighbors. The patches are randomly chosen, but are somewhat user-adjustable (you can change the width of the window --> window size). The basic assignment/problem is included (in the pdf). More information on the algorithm exists [here](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/EfrosLeung.html).
