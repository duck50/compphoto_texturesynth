# *Document Similarity Assignment for Mathematical Applications for Computer Science* - NYU

# What is this repo?
This is just a proof of concept solution (in Matlab) for finding the similarity of two text *documents* (or user-input text arrays as in this case) using the vector model of documents (some basic Linear Algebra). The GetStopwords file contains stop words--> common words that are not significant. More information about the problem can be found within the included pdf. 

You can call the function in Matlab like so: *DocSimilarity(textdoc1,textdoc2)*
